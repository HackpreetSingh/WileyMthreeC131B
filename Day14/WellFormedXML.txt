Well Formed XML

1. every xml file must have just one root element
2. all opening tags must have a closing tag
3. all attribute values must be enclosed in double quotes
4. all the elements must be nested correctly i.e. if we have nesting of elements like
<parents>
	<child>
		<subchild>
		</subchild>
	</child>
</parent>
